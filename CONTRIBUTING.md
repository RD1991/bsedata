# How to contribute

## Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/sdabhi23/bsedata/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/sdabhi23/bsedata/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. Don't forget to the tag `bug` on your issue.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Suggest your change by [opening a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sdabhi23/bsedata/issues/new). Don't forget to the tag `enhancement` on your issue.

* Changes which create a dependency on the APIs used by the [new BSE website](https://www.bseindia.com/) are generally rejected as they keep breaking because of security changes on the APIs. These APIs generally start with something like **`https://api.bseindia.com/BseIndiaAPI/api/`**. [Example 1](https://github.com/sdabhi23/bsedata/pull/30) [Example 2](https://github.com/sdabhi23/bsedata/pull/29) [Example 3](https://github.com/sdabhi23/bsedata/pull/45)

## Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

* Please make sure that you fully understand what this library does & do not propose irrelevant or bad changes. [Example](https://github.com/sdabhi23/bsedata/pull/44).
